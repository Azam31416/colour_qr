# Colour QR - An RGB QR generator
A simple python based RGB QR generator which has the capacity to store 3 B/W (Black and White) QRs in a sigle RGB QR which increases the data density. As cameras can capture the colours also, it is a good thing that can be easily implemented. Possible use case- for storing large text chunk in a QR.

## How to run
Open the folder containing the code and run
```console
foo@bar:~/colour_qr$ python colour_qr.py
Lorem ipsum odor amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.dds

foo@bar:~/colour_qr$
```
